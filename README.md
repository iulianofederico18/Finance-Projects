DCF model and valuation analysis of BESI N.V.
This repository contains a personal project focused on the valuation of BESI N.V., a dutch company, using a Discounted Cash Flow DCF model built in excel

## Objective
The goal of this project  was to estimate the intrinsic value of Besi N.V. through a DCF approach and to compare the result with the current market price. This exercise was developed as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate financial modeling and valuation skills.

## Methodology
- Built a DCF in Excel based on forecasted Free Cash Flows (FCF).
- To Forecast the components of FCF assumptions were made based primarily on consensus estimates that were freely accessible on the internet
- Due to the cyclical nature of BESI's sector, 4 different scenarios were forecasted: 1 = base scenario, 2 = upside scenario, 3 = downside 1 scenario, 4 = downside 2 scenario
- The assumptions made are explained in the model

## Results
- **Fair Value (DCF estimate): ~€70/share**  
- **Market Price at the time of analysis: ~€110/share**  
- The discrepancy can be explained by:  
  - Conservative assumptions on long-term growth and margins in the model.  
  - A relatively higher discount rate compared to some sell-side reports.  
  - Market expectations of strong future drivers (e.g., advanced packaging, AI-related demand) that may justify higher multiples
